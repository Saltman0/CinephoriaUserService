# Set working directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# dependencies (better layer caching)

# Download dependencies as a separate step to take advantage of Docker's caching.
# Leverage a cache mount to /root/.local/share/pnpm/store to speed up subsequent builds.
# Leverage a bind mounts to package.json and pnpm-lock.yaml to avoid having to copy them into
# into this layer.
